Tell us your name, course, your experience with Git (if any) and your favorite pizza (hint hint)!

## Introduce GitHub!
**Share your ideas**
**What do you think Git is? What is it used for? Why is it important? What are the main aspects of Git?**
- Git is a way to share code with other people
- Fomatting, syntatical 
- Work on different versions of the same code base (useful in operations -- use different branches and test out different ideas)

_Welcome to "Introduction to GitHub"! :wave:_

**What is GitHub?**: GitHub is a collaboration platform that uses [Git](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#git) for versioning. GitHub is a popular place to share and contribute to [open-source](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#open-source) software.
<br>:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)

**What is a repository?**: A [repository](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#repository) is a project containing files and folders. A repository tracks versions of files and folders.
<br>:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)

**What is a branch?**: A [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#branch) is a parallel version of your repository. By default, your repository has one branch named `main` and it is considered to be the definitive branch. You can create additional branches off of `main` in your repository. You can use branches to have different versions of a project at one time.

On additional branches, you can make edits without impacting the `main` version. Branches allow you to separate your work from the `main` branch. In other words, everyone's work is safe while you contribute.

### :keyboard: Activity: Your first branch

1. Open a new browser tab, and navigate to this repository..
2. Navigate to the **Code** tab.
3. Click on the **main** branch drop-down.<br>
   <img alt="image showing my-first-branch entry" src="/images/my-first-branch.png"/>
4. In the field, enter a name for your branch: `[yourname]-branch`. (Where '[yourname]' is actually your name)
5. Click **Create branch: [yourname]-branch** to create your branch.
6. Move on to Step 2!
  
Now, we should have a GitHub account set up online and Git installed on our laptops. 

1. In the repository, find the “code” button and then the clipboard icon to copy the HTML URL.
2. In terminal, navigate to a directory where you want to copy the repository.
  ```
  cd Desktop
  mkdir oxwocs
  git clone [copied URL]
  cd oxwocs
  ```
3. This command will list all branches.
```
  git branch
  ``` 
  These commands will create a new branch titled [yourname]_branch and then checkout the specified branch.
  ```
  git branch [yourname]_branch
  git checkout [yourname]_branch
  ```
4. Move on to step 2!

<summary><h2>Step 2: Commit a file</h2></summary>

_You created a branch! :tada:_

Creating a branch allows you to edit your project without changing the `main` branch. Now that you have a branch, it’s time to create a file and make your first commit!

**What is a commit?**: A [commit](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits) is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch.

### :keyboard: Activity: Your first commit

The following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub. Committing a change requires first adding a new file to your new branch. 

1. On the **Code** tab, make sure you're on your new branch `[yourname]-branch`.
2. Select the **Add file** drop-down and click **Create new file**.<br>
   ![create new file option](/images/create-new-file.png)
3. In the **Name your file...** field, enter `[YOURNAME]PROFILE.md`.
4. In the **Edit new file** area, copy the following content to your file:
   ```
   Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is [yourname]
   ```
   <img alt="profile.md file screenshot" src="/images/my-profile-file.png"/>
5. For commits, you can enter a short commit message that describes what changes you made. This message helps others know what's included in your commit. GitHub offers a simple default message, but let's change it slightly for practice. First, enter `Add PROFILE.md` in the first text-entry field below **Commit new file**. Then, if you want to confirm what your screen should look like, expand the dropdown below.
   <details>
   <summary> Expand to see the screenshot.</summary>
   <img alt="screenshot of adding a new file with a commit message" src="/images/commit-full-screen.png" />
   </details>
6. In this lesson, we'll ignore the other fields and click **Commit new file**.
7. Move on to Step 3!
  
1. On terminal type the command:
  ```
  vim [yourname]_profile.md
  ```
2. Type i or a to go into insert mode. Then write
3. Hi my name is [yourname] and I like to code! (or something similar)
4. Hit escape and type “:wq” to save and quit your file
5. Now we can see the newly committed file.
  ```
  ls
  ```
6.Add files you want to add to your commit and then commit your changes!
  ```
  git add [yourname]_profile.md
  git commit
  ```
7. Now add a commit message. They should be succinct and informative like “Created a profile file for Juyon”
8. Hit escape and “:wq” then enter.
9. We can not push our commits. But before we do, we'll need to set up a personal access token. Follow the instructions here to find your PAT: 
[Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
10. Now let's push our commit
  ```
  git push --set-upstream origin [yourname]_branch
  ```
  Now, you can use your Git username and PAT to authenticate.
10. Congratulations! You’ve made your first commit!!

<!-- 
  <<< Author notes: Step 3 >>> 
  Just a historic note: the previous version of this step forced the learner
  to write a pull request description,
  checked that `main` was the receiving branch,
  and that the file was named correctly.
-->

<details id=3>
<summary><h2>Step 3: Open a pull request</h2></summary>

_Nice work making that commit :sparkles:_

Now that you’ve created a commit, it’s time to share your proposed change through a pull request!

**What is a pull request?**: Collaboration happens on a pull request. The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people. This pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the `main` branch.
<br>:tv: [Video: Introduction to pull requests](https://youtu.be/kJr-PIfLDl4)

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a pull request

You may have noticed after your commit that a message displayed indicating your recent push to your branch and providing a button that says **Compare & pull request**.

![screenshot of message and button](/images/compare-and-pull-request.png)

 If you want, feel free to click **Compare & pull request**, and then skip to step 6 below. If you don't click the button, the instructions below walk you through manually setting up the pull request.

1. Click on the **Pull requests** tab in your repository.
2. Click **New pull request**.
3. In the **base:** dropdown, make sure **main** is selected.
4. Select the **compare:** dropdown, and click `my-first-branch`. <br>
   <img alt="screenshot showing both branch selections" src="/images/pull-request-branches.png"/>
5. Click **Create pull request**.
6. Enter a title for your pull request: `Add my first file`.
7. The next field helps you provide a description of the changes you made. Feel free to add a description of what you’ve accomplished so far. As a reminder, you have: created a branch, created a file and made a commit! <br>
   <img alt="screenshot showing pull request" src="/images/Pull-request-description.png"/>
8. Click **Create pull request**.
9. Move on to Step 4! 

</details>

<!-- 
  <<< Author notes: Step 4 >>> 
  Just a historic note: The previous version of this step required responding
  to a pull request review before merging. The previous version also handled
  if users accidentally closed without merging.
-->

<details id=4>
<summary><h2>Step 4: Merge your pull request</h2></summary>

_Nicely done friend! :sunglasses:_

You successfully created a pull request. You can now merge your pull request.

**What is a _merge_**: A [merge](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#merge) adds the changes in your pull request and branch into the `main` branch.
<br>:tv: [Video: Understanding the GitHub flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBI2Rz-ZOxU)

As noted in the previous step, you may have seen evidence of an action running which automatically progresses your instructions to the next step. You'll have to wait for it to finish before you can merge your pull request. It will be ready when the merge pull request button is green.

![screenshot of green merge pull request button](/images/Green-merge-pull-request.png)
### :keyboard: Activity: Merge the pull request

1. Click **Merge pull request**.
1. Click **Confirm merge**.
1. Once your branch has been merged, you don't need it anymore. To delete this branch, click **Delete branch**.<br>
   <img alt="screenshot showing delete branch button" src="/images/delete-branch.png"/>
2. Check out the **Finish** step to see what you can learn next!<br>
   **Note**: Like before, you can wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from) and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically close this step and open the next one.
